## üöÄ About The Project

**Streamify** is a full-featured, real-time video call and chat application designed to connect language learners from around the world. It's built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and powered by the Stream API for robust, scalable chat and video functionalities.

The platform allows users to find language exchange partners, send friend requests, chat in real-time, and launch high-quality video calls directly from the app. It features a secure JWT authentication system, a modern responsive UI, and a clean, intuitive user experience.

## üìã How It Works: The User Flow

The application provides a seamless experience from finding a partner to having a conversation.

1.  **Authentication**: A user first visits the site and is presented with a **Login** or **Sign Up** page.
2.  **Sign Up & Login**: New users can register, and existing users can log in. The backend validates credentials and returns a **JWT (JSON Web Token)** for session management.
3.  **Authorization**: This JWT is used to protect all core application routes, ensuring only logged-in users can access the dashboard, chats, and calls.
4.  **Find Learners**: After logging in, the user lands on the main dashboard. Here, they can browse profiles of "New Learners," clearly seeing each user's **Native Language** and **Learning Language**.
5.  **Friend Request System**: Users can send friend requests to potential partners.
6.  **Notifications**: The "Notifications" tab alerts users when their friend requests have been accepted, turning a "New Learner" into a "Friend."
7.  **Real-time Chat**: Users can open a chat window with their connected friends to send text messages and image attachments in real-time.
8.  **Initiate Video Call**: From any chat window, a user can instantly start a 1-on-1 video call by sending a unique, secure join link directly into the chat.
9.  **Video Call**: Both users can join the video call room, which includes controls for muting the mic, toggling the camera, sharing their screen, and ending the call.
